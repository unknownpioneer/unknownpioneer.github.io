    <p>Hi there. Recently, some modfications have been made aimed to improve the surface of the website. (Emphasise on
        record.html and index.html) In the
        meantime, some curious babies discovered that a new webpage direction was created on the index.<br>The link will
        direct you to <em>Q3dlaxpoaQ</em>, who is our new-come collaborator.</p>
    <p>You may wonder: who is the new-to, unrecongnized person? I won't tell you, because further discoveries are always
        made by the people who are willing to dig farther.<br>Anyway, with his support, pusing forwards construction
        of the website is no longer a difficulties.</p>
    <p>In addition to a new colleague, the record.html will be undergoing a massive migration. As I just found that
        separating
        all the sections into different articles on different pages will be convenient for me to manage them. Before the
        change
        is done, the record.html will be closed temporarily. It won't take ages.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, If you have any suggestions regarding this website, please post a Issue on the <a
            href="https://github.com/unknownpioneer/unknownpioneer.github.io/issues" title="Issue">Github</a>.</p>
    <p>A lot of appreciations!</p>
