    <p>If you are a member of the TF2China channel, you may have inspected a post written by me. Throughout this letter,
        I expressed my strong appreciation towards my "colleagues" and "dorm-colleagues". However, in the next few days,
        everything overturns. So many destructive things, like deliberate ignorance, charged towards me violently and
        unexpectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, I want to explain, what things took place and how they affect me.
    </p>
    <p>
        To begin with, I wanna talk about the person who "sent me a message regularly". Previously, I regard him as a
        human beings filled with kindness and forgiveness. Despite some slight conflicts, we still go through it at
        last. I had used him as my older avatar if you had paid enough attention to my user profile.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        However, when some intolerable problems exposed, I've finally recongized that I can't just stand there.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        One day when I was attempting to focus my attention on studying, his statement towards C(One of my
        dorm-colleagues, who
        will be mentioned later), which were really horrible, could be clearly heard.
        I can still remember what he said: <q>They're all suck, and I just want to play the Genshin Impact with
            you.</q><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        The above is just an example. In contrast to what he had told me in dorm, I suspect that his friendly attitude
        towards me is completely fake. His hidden purpose is to attract the C by using the little BEUFK. Unfortunately,
        I haven't got any direct evidence which can be used to accuse his guilty.<br>
