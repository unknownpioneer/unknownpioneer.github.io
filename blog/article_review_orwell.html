        I have finished the Game (Orwell : keeping an eye on you) . I can't understand the ending... <br>
        It's a story about a radical team "Thought",which has made an act of terrorism and caused death cases.<br>
        At the end of the game, the "Thought" is considered a terrorism organization. And most of their members have
        been arrested.<br>
        Personally, although living under a surveillance society is unsuitable for me.<br>
        We really need some necessary <q>CCTVs</q> to clean up terrorism.<br>
        P.S. the first picture seems to be a scene in the novel<q><em>1984</em></q>. Google it for further information.<br>
        Big Brother is watching you...<br>
